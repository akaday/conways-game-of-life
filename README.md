# Conway's Game of Life

## Description
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell changes based on a set of rules, and the game progresses through generations.
